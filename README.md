# Power_Analysis_Fish
Fish guidance structures (FGSs) are structures placed at hydraulic power stations to guide fish migrating downstream off the turbines, where many of them die after being hit by the blades. Researchers at ETH Zurich conducted experiments in 2018 and 2019 to test different configurations of FGSs to determine which one is more efficient at guiding fish off the turbines.

This project is a power analysis to determine the number of fish required for different power levels, as well as defining how the experiments should be conducted from a statistical point of view.
